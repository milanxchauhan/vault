## The AARRR! Framework
-- Created by Dave Mcclure of 500 startups  
-- A well structured thoery for building and testing new products or startups  

**The idea is you go down this route:**  
i) Acquisition - How do users find you?  
ii) Activation - Do users have a great first experience?  
iii) Retention - Do they come back?  
iv) Revenue - How do you make money?At what point do you charge the user?  
v) Referrals - Do users tell others?

What newbie product managers think is a typical Saas flow: Sign up --> Payment --> Convert to customer  

What real Saas flow is like: Sign up --> Email after 1 week --> Re-sign-in --> Webinar participation --> Call with sales --> Second call with sales --> Payment --> Convert to customer  

**Key Metrics**  
- Acquisition
  - CTR (Click Through Rate)  
  - CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)  
  - Landing page conversion rate  
- Activation  
  - Time on site/app  
  - Bounce rate  
  - CPS (Cost per sign up)  
  - Successful onboarding  
- Retention  
  - DAU (Daily Active Users)
  - MAU (Monthly Active Users)  
  - Churn rate  
- Revenue  
  - ARPU (Daily Active Users)  
  - LTV (Lifetime value)  
  - Revenue churn rate  
  - ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), MRR (Month Recurring Revenue)  
- Referalls  
  - NPS (Net Promoter Score)  
  - Invitations sent  
  - App installs per invite  
  - Signups per invite (Loop rate)  

**Activation**  
-- Small window to get the user to understand the "aha" moment  
-- Less important for e-commerce businesses
-- Trial periods  
-- Twitter asks you to follow some people, Apple music asks you to pick some genres and artists, Dropbox asks you to upload a file  

-- Activation criteria could be -
  - 2-3 page views
  - 10-30 spent on website  
  - 3-5 clicks  
  - 1 key feature used  

**Retention**  
-- Retain users using notifications, alerts and emails  
-- Facebook's "Your friend mentioned you in a comment" is an example of retention feature  
-- Lifecycle emails using Mautic.org(free)
  - Send emails every 5, 10, 15 days
  - Send a break-up email after 30 days
  - Event based emails as they occur  

-- Use content to re-engage users. Users may churn because they are busy or not interested enough!  
-- Build an oxygen product. A product that people can't survive without.  

**Net Promoter Score**  
-- Use the Net Promoter Score system (usually send this in an email) to ask users how happy they are with their product.  
-- If score > 8/10, ask people to refer it to their friends!  
-- Invite only/exclusive invites allow people to play status games!

**Referalls**  
Uber did this in the early days. They gave users a promo code to share with friends. Every time someone signs up using their code, they get discounts or free rides.  

**App Structure**
